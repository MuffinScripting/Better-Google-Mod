**HOW TO SET UP** <br>
<p1><b>For "Basic Edit"</b> Open Inspect Element ( Ctrl+Shift+I / Ctrl+Shift+C ) and view the HTML code. Next, go to the part of the HTML that says 
"itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/WebPage" lang="en"" and right-click it. After that, press "Edit as HTML".
Delete all of the code inside, and paste this code to replace it. Last, click out of the Inspect Element, and most logos and 
text will be changed. More files will change color for dark mode.<br><br>
